- Your Ableton serial number (if it hasnâ€™t been registered to your ableton.com account yet)

- Your hardware code: 2104-617A-2F98-218F-FC72-F1E4

Go to this page on a separate internet-connected computer to download an authorization file from your account: https://www.ableton.com/account/authorize/offline/
